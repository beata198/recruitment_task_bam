# Recruitment Project â€“ Junior Frontend Developer

This project was created as part of a recruitment task for the position of Junior Frontend Developer.

The goal was to build a simple, interactive advertising unit presented as a mobile-responsive website.

## Task Summary

- Build a mobile-first website using provided graphic assets (background, headlines, product images, video).

- Organize the source code into clear modules/components using JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and SCSS.

- Use GSAP for animations and Swiper.js for an interactive product gallery.

- Compile all JS and SCSS into single bundle.js and style.css files included in the index.html.

- Host the solution in a Git repository with proper version control.

### Functional Requirements

- Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices.
- Orientation lock on mobile: if device is in landscape mode, show overlay asking to rotate to portrait and hide main content.
- Three distinct scenes:
  - Intro: shown on page load, automatically moves to the gallery after 8 seconds.
  - Gallery: shows a product image slider with navigation and a pulsing CTA button.
  - Video: displays a looping product video positioned based on the clicked gallery slide.
- Product gallery managed with a dedicated JavaScript class using Swiper.js.
- Event tracking logs key user interactions and page lifecycle events to the console.

## Stack Technologies

- HTML5 + SCSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Swiper.js
- GSAP
- Vite

## Features

- Responsive layout (desktop and mobile)
- Screen lock with overlay when device is in landscape orientation on mobile devices
- Custom animation timeline using GSAP for intro scene
- Product gallery where clicking different slides triggers different video behaviors.
- Videos play in a loop with sound:

  - Click on slide 1: video appears in the top-left corner.
  - Click on slide 2: video appears in the top-right corner.
  - Click on slide 3: video appears in the bottom-left corner.
  - Click on slide 4: video appears in the bottom-right corner.

- Event tracking for key interactions:
  - `ad_load`: When the page has loaded.
  - `window_resize`: Every time the browser window is resized.
  - `page_hide`: When the user leaves the page ( switches tabs).
  - `scene_change:{scene_name}`: When a specific scene becomes visible (`scene_change:intro`, `scene_change:gallery`, `scene_change:video`).
  - `user_interaction:slide_click:{slide_index}`: After clicking a slide in the gallery (e.g., `user_interaction:slide_click:1`).
  - `user_interaction:cta_click`: After clicking the CTA button.

## ðŸš€ Development

Clone repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/beata198/recruitment_task_bam.git
cd recruitment_task_bam
```

To run the project locally in development mode:

```
npm install       # Install all dependencies
npm run dev       # Start local development server
```

To generate the production build (bundled and optimized):

```
The source code (JavaScript and SCSS) is compiled and bundled into:

* bundle.js â€“ final JavaScript bundle
* style.css â€“ compiled CSS file
```

```
npm install       # Install all dependencies
npm run build
```

Run after build

```
cd dist
npm run preview
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Choice: Why Vanilla JavaScript?

This project was intentionally built using **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**, without any JavaScript frameworks (like React, Vue, or Angular).

### Why this approach?

- âœ… **Lightweight**: Avoiding a framework keeps the bundle size minimal and fast to load, especially important for projects like banners or micro frontends.
- âœ… **Full control**: Using plain JS and modular architecture gives full control over DOM manipulation, performance optimization, and third-party integrations.
- âœ… **Learning showcase**: Showing a understanding of core web technologies â€” JavaScript, SCSS, HTML â€” without abstracting the logic behind a framework.
